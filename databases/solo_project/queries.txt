1. Display the information in one table.

## INPUT 
sqlite> SELECT * FROM animals;

1|Malayan Tiger|1|3|true
2|Snowy Owl|2|20|false
3|River Otter|1|1|true
4|Red-Footed Tortise|3|10|true

## Input
sqlite> UPDATE animals SET in_exhibit="true" WHERE name="Snowy Owl";
sqlite> SELECT * FROM animals;

## Output
1|Malayan Tiger|1|3|true
2|Snowy Owl|2|20|true
3|River Otter|1|1|true
4|Red-Footed Tortise|3|10|true

Display the information in both tables using one query.
Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

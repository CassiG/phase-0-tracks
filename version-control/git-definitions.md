# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way to track and save changs made to a code base. It is usefull so that if you need to remove a feature or a new feature added to your code is broken you can roll back to a previous version of the code without having to start from scratch or breaking your codebase. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is like a copy of the code you're working on, a seperate area where you can make changes to code to make sure it works before adding the changes to the main code - to help prevent breaking software

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a record of changes made to a repository, so if you can roll back you can easily find what changes were made recently and find where you want to roll back to. A good commit message is a descriptive message outlining the changes made to the code. Good format is to add it in a present-tense form such as "Added answers to the git-definitions markdown file"

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two or more people try to modify the same peice of code and then merge it with the master file

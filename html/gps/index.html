	<h4>Release 4: Reflect</h4>
    <p><strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</strong><br>HTML semantic tags are used to classify and structure the content on the web page. The footer and the nav are the most useful because they link all the pages of the website together into a functioning page.</p>

	<p><strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</strong><br>
	The order follows the basic structure of a text document or index page; the header followed by the body with the footer located at the bottom of the page.</p>

	<p><strong>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</strong><br>
	Sublime uses snippets to allow the developer to create triggers to access content without having to provide the content  or search for it manually.</p>

	<p><strong>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</strong><br>
	The most challenging concept is when and where to use the different semantic tags. The more we try out using different tags to accomplish the  same function on our web pages, the more we will understand the various uses of the semantic tags and how to use them interchangeably. Reviewing online resources like W3School help provide alternate examples of how and when to use the semantic tags.</p>

       <p><strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</strong><br>The HTML5 semantic tags help break up HTML body content in a way that makes things easier to read and navigate. It groups the code together in ways that make sense. I find header and footer tags useful because they're very straightforward in what they are. </p>

       <p><strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</strong><br>Browsers display elements like a text document where there is a header, body, and footer</p>

       <p><strong>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</strong><br>We learned how to use and create Sublime snippets. I love using shortcuts so I'll definitely be creating more in the future</p>

       <p><strong>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</strong><br>I found understanding certain semantic elements challenging, especially ones that aren't as straight forward like where to use main, or article. I found the W3Schools HTML documents very helpful in this. Bookmarking these resources will definitely help improve my understanding of them. </p>

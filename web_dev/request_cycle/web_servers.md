1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
- The key design philosphy is that you can do (update, change, delete) anything in your Linux operating system. The idea is that it won't warn or stop you if you're about to do something bad, but without these restrictions you can have more flexability to try more things with your system. 
- Every program does one thing well - if you run in a command in linux, it's only going to do one thing - but because of that it will perform very fast. 
- It's free. Linux operates on the idea that eveyrone should have it so it doen't cost anything to get it or run it. 


2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A regular server is a physical object that exists in a real world. It might be bunched together with other servers in a server farm. If you use server space to host your website, you'll use a whole one of these servers. If you don't need that much space, you can use a virtual server, or VPS server. You could do shared hosting to be able to use split space and only use as much as you need, but it's not private. VPS offers that privacy as well. 

Advantages of using it are it is 
- cost effective (not paying for a whole server)
- more stability because your server isn't being affected by other users. 

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
root is a super user on your system and can do anything. If you're operating as root - if a virus, hacker, etc. gets into your system - because you're applications are all running at root they now have access to your root and can destroy your system. Creating a user helps create a layer of security that protects your system from these things.

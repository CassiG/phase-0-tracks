1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
- The key design philosphy is that you can do (update, change, delete) anything in your Linux operating system. The idea is that it won't warn or stop you if you're about to do something bad, but without these restrictions you can have more flexability to try more things with your system. 
- Every program does one thing well - if you run in a command in linux, it's only going to do one thing - but because of that it will perform very fast. 
- It's free. Linux operates on the idea that eveyrone should have it so it doen't cost anything to get it or run it.

#Tackling JQuery in 2 Hours

_What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important?__

To tackle this task first I'm going to time box it. I'm a big fan of the Pomodoro technique so for this task I'll use a mini version of it and break up my learning into four 25-minute sprints with a 5 minute break in between to stretch and let my brain process what I just learned. 

My brain works best to research and then test so how I will break this up is the following: resource gathering, researching, testing, relfection. 

# Resource Gathering 10 mins/ Researching - 15 minutes
Spend some time looking up JQuery guides, cheat sheets, and tips. Spend this time reading through the guides I collected, taking notes on things I want to try. 

# Testing - 25 minutes
Expirimenting with testing some of the things I've researched, and begin gathering notes on jquery techniques I want to try

#Repeat

# Reflection - 25 minutes
Spending some time filling in any gaps in knowledge/questions I had from the testing phase and solidifying how to do the specific jquery tactics I want to try for the project.

### jQuery syntax and methods to try - general notes
After doing some research and looking up methods, I've found the best learning style right now is to find a cheatsheet and try out different functions - just googling questions as I had them during the trial and error.
